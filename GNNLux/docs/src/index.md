# GNNLux.jl 

GNNLux.jl is a work-in-progress package that implements stateless graph convolutional layers, fully compatible with the [Lux.jl](https://lux.csail.mit.edu/stable/) machine learning framework. It is built on top of the GNNGraphs.jl, GNNlib.jl, and Lux.jl packages.

The full documentation will be available soon.
