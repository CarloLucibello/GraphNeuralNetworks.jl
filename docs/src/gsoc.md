# Graph Neural Networks - Summer of Code

Graph neural networks (GNN) are deep learning model well adapated to data that can be rapresented by graph topologies and feature vectors leaving on nodes and edges.
[GraphNeuralNetworks.jl](https://github.com/CarloLucibello/GraphNeuralNetworks.jl) is a pure Julia package for GNNs already equipped with plenty of features such as many common graph convolutional layers, CUDA support and graph batching for fast parallel operations. There are a number of ways that the package could be improved:

- **Adding convolutional layers (duration: 175h, expected difficulty: easy to medium):**
.

- **Adding models and examples (duration: 175h, expected difficulty: medium):**
.

- **Adding graph datasets (duration: 175h, expected difficulty: easy):**
.

- **Supporting heterogeneous graphs (duration: 175h, expected difficulty: hard):**
.

- **Supporting training on very large graphs (duration: 175h, expected difficulty: medium to hard):**
.

- **Supporting temporal graph neural networks (duration: 175h, expected difficulty: hard):**
.

- **Improving perfomance using sparse linear algebra (duration: 175h, expected difficulty: medium to hard):** 
.

**Recommended skills:** Familiarity with graph neural networks and Flux.jl.

**Expected results:** New features added to the package along with tests and relevant documentation.
