    "## Mini-batching of graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Since graphs in graph classification datasets are usually small, a good idea is to **batch the graphs** before inputting them into a Graph Neural Network to guarantee full GPU utilization.\n",
    "In the image or language domain, this procedure is typically achieved by **rescaling** or **padding** each example into a set of equally-sized shapes, and examples are then grouped in an additional dimension.\n",
    "The length of this dimension is then equal to the number of examples grouped in a mini-batch and is typically referred to as the `batchsize`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for GNNs the two approaches described above are either not feasible or may result in a lot of unnecessary memory consumption.\n",
    "Therefore, GNN.jl opts for another approach to achieve parallelization across a number of examples. Here, adjacency matrices are stacked in a diagonal fashion (creating a giant graph that holds multiple isolated subgraphs), and node and target features are simply concatenated in the node dimension (the last dimension).\n",
    "\n",
    "This procedure has some crucial advantages over other batching procedures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. GNN operators that rely on a message passing scheme do not need to be modified since messages are not exchanged between two nodes that belong to different graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. There is no computational or memory overhead since adjacency matrices are saved in a sparse fashion holding only non-zero entries, *i.e.*, the edges.\n",
    "\n",
