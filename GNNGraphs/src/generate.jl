    rand_graph([rng,] n, m; bidirected=true, edge_weight = nothing, kws...)

Generate a random (Erdós-Renyi) `GNNGraph` with `n` nodes and `m` edges.

If `bidirected=true` the reverse edge of each edge will be present.
If `bidirected=false` instead, `m` unrelated edges are generated.
In any case, the output graph will contain no self-loops or multi-edges.

A vector can be passed  as `edge_weight`. Its length has to be equal to `m`
in the directed case, and `m÷2` in the bidirected one.

Pass a random number generator as the first argument to make the generation reproducible.

Additional keyword arguments will be passed to the [`GNNGraph`](@ref) constructor.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> g = rand_graph(5, 4, bidirected=false)
GNNGraph:
    num_nodes = 5
    num_edges = 4

julia> edge_index(g)
([1, 3, 3, 4], [5, 4, 5, 2])

# In the bidirected case, edge data will be duplicated on the reverse edges if needed.
julia> g = rand_graph(5, 4, edata=rand(Float32, 16, 2))

    num_nodes = 5

specifing node/edge types and their numbers.

Use a `seed > 0` for reproducibility.

Setting `bidirected=true` will generate a bidirected graph, i.e. each edge will have a reverse edge.

Create a random temporal graph given `number_nodes` nodes and `number_snapshots` snapshots.
First, the positions of the nodes are randomly generated in the unit square. Two nodes are connected if their distance is less than a given radius `r`.
Each following snapshot is obtained by applying the same construction to new positions obtained as follows.
For each snapshot, the new positions of the points are determined by applying random independent displacement vectors to the previous positions. The direction of the displacement is chosen uniformly at random and its length is chosen uniformly in `[0, speed]`. Then the connections are recomputed.
If a point happens to move outside the boundary, its position is updated as if it had bounced off the boundary.

# Arguments

- `number_nodes`: The number of nodes of each snapshot.
- `number_snapshots`: The number of snapshots.
- `speed`: The speed to update the nodes.
- `r`: The radius of connection.
- `self_loops`: If `true`, consider the node itself among its neighbors, in which
                case the graph will contain self-loops. 
- `dir`: The direction of the edges. If `dir=:in` edges go from the

First, the positions of the nodes are generated with a quasi-uniform distribution (depending on the parameter `α`) in hyperbolic space within a disk of radius `R`. Two nodes are connected if their hyperbolic distance is less than `R`. Each following snapshot is created in order to keep the same initial distribution.

# Arguments

- `number_snapshots`: The number of snapshots.
- `α`: The parameter that controls the position of the points. If `α=ζ`, the points are uniformly distributed on the disk of radius `R`. If `α>ζ`, the points are more concentrated in the center of the disk. If `α<ζ`, the points are more concentrated at the boundary of the disk.
- `R`: The radius of the disk and of connection.
- `speed`: The speed to update the nodes.
- `ζ`: The parameter that controls the curvature of the disk.
- `self_loops`: If `true`, consider the node itself among its neighbors, in which
