# Datasets

GNNGraphs.jl doesn't come with its own datasets, but leverages those available in the Julia (and non-Julia) ecosystem. In particular, the [examples in the GraphNeuralNetworks.jl repository](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/GraphNeuralNetworks.jl/tree/master/examples) make use of the [MLDatasets.jl](https://github.com/JuliaML/MLDatasets.jl) package. There you will find common graph datasets such as Cora, PubMed, Citeseer, TUDataset and [many others](https://juliaml.github.io/MLDatasets.jl/dev/datasets/graphs/).
For graphs with static structures and temporal features, datasets such as METRLA, PEMSBAY, ChickenPox, and WindMillEnergy are available. For graphs featuring both temporal structures and temporal features, the TemporalBrains dataset is suitable.

GraphNeuralNetworks.jl provides the [`mldataset2gnngraph`](@ref) method for interfacing with MLDatasets.jl.
