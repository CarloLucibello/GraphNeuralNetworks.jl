<div class="markdown"><h1>Graph Classification with Graph Neural Networks</h1><p><em>This Pluto notebook is a julia adaptation of the Pytorch Geometric tutorials that can be found <a href="https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/colabs.html">here</a>.</em></p><p>In this tutorial session we will have a closer look at how to apply <strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to the task of graph classification</strong>. Graph classification refers to the problem of classifying entire graphs (in contrast to nodes), given a <strong>dataset of graphs</strong>, based on some structural graph properties. Here, we want to embed entire graphs, and we want to embed those graphs in such a way so that they are linearly separable given a task at hand.</p><p>The most common task for graph classification is <strong>molecular property prediction</strong>, in which molecules are represented as graphs, and the task may be to infer whether a molecule inhibits HIV virus replication or not.</p><p>The TU Dortmund University has collected a wide range of different graph classification datasets, known as the <a href="https://chrsmrrs.github.io/datasets/"><strong>TUDatasets</strong></a>, which are also accessible via MLDatasets.jl. Let's load and inspect one of the smaller ones, the <strong>MUTAG dataset</strong>:</p></div>

## Mini-batching of graphs
```@raw html
<div class="markdown">
<p>Since graphs in graph classification datasets are usually small, a good idea is to <strong>batch the graphs</strong> before inputting them into a Graph Neural Network to guarantee full GPU utilization. In the image or language domain, this procedure is typically achieved by <strong>rescaling</strong> or <strong>padding</strong> each example into a set of equally-sized shapes, and examples are then grouped in an additional dimension. The length of this dimension is then equal to the number of examples grouped in a mini-batch and is typically referred to as the <code>batchsize</code>.</p><p>However, for GNNs the two approaches described above are either not feasible or may result in a lot of unnecessary memory consumption. Therefore, GraphNeuralNetworks.jl opts for another approach to achieve parallelization across a number of examples. Here, adjacency matrices are stacked in a diagonal fashion (creating a giant graph that holds multiple isolated subgraphs), and node and target features are simply concatenated in the node dimension (the last dimension).</p><p>This procedure has some crucial advantages over other batching procedures:</p><ol><li><p>GNN operators that rely on a message passing scheme do not need to be modified since messages are not exchanged between two nodes that belong to different graphs.</p></li><li><p>There is no computational or memory overhead since adjacency matrices are saved in a sparse fashion holding only non-zero entries, <em>i.e.</em>, the edges.</p></li></ol><p>GraphNeuralNetworks.jl can <strong>batch multiple graphs into a single giant graph</strong>:</p></div>

<div class="markdown"><p>As one can see, our model reaches around <strong>74% test accuracy</strong>. Reasons for the fluctuations in accuracy can be explained by the rather small dataset (only 38 test graphs), and usually disappear once one applies GNNs to larger datasets.</p><h2>(Optional) Exercise</h2><p>Can we do better than this? As multiple papers pointed out (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00826">Xu et al. (2018)</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02244">Morris et al. (2018)</a>), applying <strong>neighborhood normalization decreases the expressivity of GNNs in distinguishing certain graph structures</strong>. An alternative formulation (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02244">Morris et al. (2018)</a>) omits neighborhood normalization completely and adds a simple skip-connection to the GNN layer in order to preserve central node information:</p><p class="tex">$$\mathbf{x}_i^{(\ell+1)} = \mathbf{W}^{(\ell + 1)}_1 \mathbf{x}_i^{(\ell)} + \mathbf{W}^{(\ell + 1)}_2 \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \mathbf{x}_j^{(\ell)}$$</p><p>This layer is implemented under the name <code>GraphConv</code> in GraphNeuralNetworks.jl.</p><p>As an exercise, you are invited to complete the following code to the extent that it makes use of <code>GraphConv</code> rather than <code>GCNConv</code>. This should bring you close to <strong>82% test accuracy</strong>.</p></div>

<p>In this chapter, you have learned how to apply GNNs to the task of graph classification. You have learned how graphs can be batched together for better GPU utilization, and how to apply readout layers for obtaining graph embeddings rather than node embeddings.</p></div>
