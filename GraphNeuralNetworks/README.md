GraphNeuralNetworks.jl is a graph neural network library written in Julia and based on the deep learning framework [Flux.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl).

Among its features:

* Implements common graph convolutional layers.
* Supports computations on batched graphs. 
* Easy to define custom layers.
* CUDA support.
* Integration with [Graphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/Graphs.jl).
* [Examples](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/GraphNeuralNetworks.jl/tree/master/examples) of node, edge, and graph level machine learning tasks. 
* Heterogeneous and temporal graphs. 

## Installation

GraphNeuralNetworks.jl is a registered Julia package. You can easily install it through the package manager:

```julia
pkg> add GraphNeuralNetworks
```

## Usage

Usage examples can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/GraphNeuralNetworks.jl/tree/master/examples) and in the [notebooks](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/GraphNeuralNetworks.jl/tree/master/notebooks) folder. Also, make sure to read the [documentation](https://JuliaGraphs.github.io/GraphNeuralNetworks.jl/dev) for a comprehensive introduction to the library.
