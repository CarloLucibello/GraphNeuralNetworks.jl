# GNNlib.jl

This package contains a collection deep-learning framework agnostic 
building blocks for graph neural networks such as message passing operators and implementations of graph convolutional layers. 

In the future it will serve as the foundation of GraphNeuralNetworks.jl (based on Flux,jl).
GNNlib.jl will be to GraphNeuralNetworks.jl what NNlib.jl is to Flux.jl and Lux.jl. 

This package is currently under development and may break frequentely. 
It is not meant for final users but for GNN libraries developers.
Final user should use GraphNeuralNetworks.jl instead.
